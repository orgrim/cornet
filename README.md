About
-----

The goal is to create a cron daemon which can share some cron jobs with other machines on a network. The following possibilities seems mandatory for a start:
* synchronize some cronjobs with other hosts
* allow to edit the crontab from any host
* be transparent: use compatible crontabs with other cron daemons, run aside with other cron daemons.

Source code
-----------

The source code, licensed under GNU GPL v2, is available on Github in https://github.com/orgrim/cornet

Features
--------

Mandatory for a proof of concept:

* shared crontab
* registrations/dicovery between nodes
* crontab synchronization
* edit with locks

For a real world use:

* SSL / IPv6
* cron stuff in a module
* private and public crontabs priv√©e: allowing to replace the default cron daemon
* groups of nodes with shared crontab
* at, anacron

TODO
----

* Move the following TODO stuff to the tracker
* threaded TCP server --- **done**
* threaded TCP client
* IPv6 support
* HTTP in a generic library, based on the RFC --- **in progress**
* Exchange data between nodes (on the "chandail"). Use URLs. RTFM on REST
* Parsing of crontab files
* Follow the clock and handle special cases like daylight saving time switches.
* Execute commands and take care of the shell environment
* crontab edition (unix domain socket? setuid binary (like vixie-cron)?)
